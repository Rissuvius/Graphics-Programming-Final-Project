# Graphics-Programming-Final-Project
The final project for my graphics programming class. In this class we learned how to create simple OpenGL programs. We constructed windows with textured meshes, user controls, shaders with lighting, and 2D object collisons. The work was done in C++. My final result is ugly when it comes to textures because I could not find better open source textures for the couch. I would like to improve the project in the future by updating to better textures, adding more texture variation on objects like the lamp, and also making the code more ergonomic by grouping objects into localized groups so their positions are in local instead of global coordinates.


The project has four dependencies: GLEW32, GLFW32, GLAD, and glm. Some code was provided by SNHU and my Professor Brian Battersby in the camera.h file.

I definitely want to refactor a lot of the code and continue learning OpenGL and shader programming in the future. I would also like to recreate this project in Zig.
